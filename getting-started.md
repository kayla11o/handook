# getting started

## expectations

Getting started at verb involves a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, learning the details of your new job, meeting new coworkers, all while working remotely. Your onboarding buddy, your Ops buddy, your team, and your manager are all here to help. We have no set time period for training and on-boarding periods, but most people are up to speed within the first few weeks. 

## your buddy

When you start, you’ll be assigned a buddy. Your buddy will be someone who is either apart of your squad or in the project you are working on, who’s worked at verb for a while, and who can point you in the right direction when you have a question and don’t quite know where to turn. They’ll introduce themselves during your first week, to say hi and offer their help. They’ll check in with you periodically throughout your first couple weeks to see how you’re settling in.

## setting up the tech

Our operations manager will help you set up all the accounts you need to work at verb. 

They will also set up an Asana board dedicated to your onboarding called “Welcome, [your name]!”. When you start, you’ll have access to that Asana board or project. In it, you’ll see to-dos linking to accounts or services that you need to set up. You’ll also see things that your operations manager or project manager need to set up — slack, zoom, and google workspace, among a whole list of other things. You’ll be guided through everything, so if you see something unfamiliar, don't worry.

Any specific training schedules or milestones and [Your First 90-days](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/making-a-career.md#your-first-90-days) will be in your “Welcome” Asana board.
