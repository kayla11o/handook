# what we believe

Before anything else, values come first. Without clear, shared values, we wander independently and contradict one another. Everything’s harder when we all believe different things about what’s important to *us*, our company.

Key values:

* **radical candor is the shortcut to success** 

* **put a stake in the ground** 

* **cultural resonance trumps trends**

* **success rarely comes in silos** 

* **everything is figure-out-able**
