## health insurance

### medical insurance

Medical insurance is provided in the US via Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO. The company pays 75% of the premium and the employee pays the other 25%. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally.

Each pay period, you’ll see a payroll deduction for medical insurance:

* Employee-only medical coverage: $60.90
* Employee-partner medical coverage: $128.46
* Employee-child(ren) medical coverage: $145.14
* Employee-family medical coverage: $212.70

If you’re based outside of the US and pay for private health insurance, you can request reimbursement for 75% of your insurance payments. That expense is capped at the amount Basecamp pays per employee on the US employee group plan. Ping Andrea for details.

### dental insurance

Dental insurance is provided in the US via MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally.

### vision insurance

Vision insurance is provided in the US via MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally.

### life insurance

Basecamp offers a $400,000 life insurance/AD+D policy to all employees through MetLife. It’s fully funded by Basecamp, so you pay nothing! The policy is effective on Day 1 of employment, and it’s terminated on your final day of employment. Open enrollment is in November every year, but employees are auto-enrolled during that time.

## retirement plan

While we do not currently offer a 401k, we are currently looking into getting one set up for our employees.

## flexible spending account (FSA)

The FSA is an account where you can set aside pre-tax money for out-of-pocket medical expenses, such as prescriptions, over-the-counter medicine, vision care, etc. You have to decide up front how much money you want to put in the account, and the max is $2,850/year. There is a separate type of FSA for dependent care (child or elder care), and the max for that plan is $5,000/year or $2,500/year if you split this with a partner. This is an entirely optional program. Open enrollment is in December every year, with new coverage beginning January 1.

## paid time off

### sick time

We don’t offer a bank of sick days nor do we ask you to track your sick days outside of informing the team of your absence. However if you’re unexpectedly away from work due to illness or injury for more than 3 consecutive work days, you’ll transition from sick time to unpaid leave. Verb does not pay out for unused sick time upon resignation or termination, since we have no sick time bank.

Your operations manager will check in with you if you’re consistently taking 3+ unplanned sick days per month. If you have a medical condition you know will take you away from work regularly, please work with your ops manager for accommodations.


### disclaimer on scheduling time Off

to be inserted here in regards to the length of time required for putting in OOO time and suchity such.

## family leave

If you are the primary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to 8 weeks leave at 100% pay. If you are the secondary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to  weeks leave at 100% pay. 

Some states require us to provide additional benefits.

## bereavement leave

When you lose a loved one, you can take paid time off from work for bereavement, making arrangements, settling family affairs, and attending the funeral or memorial service. Let your operations manager know your plans as soon as you can so they can arrange for your absence.

You can take ten days of bereavement leave for the death of a spouse or partner, child or child-in-law, parent or parent-in-law, or sibling or sibling-in-law. You can take three days of bereavement leave for the death of a grandparent, niece or nephew, cousin, or close friend. These caps are not to say you must return to work after so many days; you can use any of your available vacation time if you find you need more time off after bereavement leave. If you know you’ll be away from work for much longer than outlined above, please talk to your ops manager to discuss that special case.


## home office set-up

Since you work remotely, we want to make sure your home office is comfortable. You can expense up to $500 to furnish your home office with furtniture and supplies as needed through the end of the current fiscal year.


## expense account

If you work in the US, you should carry a Basecamp American Express card in your name. You can use the card for any work-related expenses, such as travel, software, or office supplies. If you have any doubts about whether or not to expense something, just ask. We require a receipt for all expenses of $50 or more. When you do buy something with the card, get a receipt! Take a photo of that receipt, and upload the receipt and then tag your expense in [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com).

If you work outside the US, the same expense policy applies, but you’ll be unable to carry a Basecamp American Express card. Instead, you’ll use [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com) to manually log any expenses you incur. Andrea will be notified of your expense and will initiate a bank transfer within Expensify for your reimbursement.

Overall, we trust our employees to spend money wisely. If you’re booking a meet-up flight, you don’t need to buy the cheapest, 2-layover redeye; buy the convenient, well-priced seat. If you’re attending a conference on behalf of Basecamp, we’ll buy your meals. Just try to stay away from caviar and champagne at dinner (okay, maybe once if you have a great day to celebrate).

Speaking of conferences — try to limit your attendance at professional conferences to once a year. Don’t extend your hotel stay too far to either side of the conference schedule; you should be traveling specifically to attend the conf. Our conference budget guidelines mirror our mini meet-up budget guidelines; you can find those in [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/22311406/documents/4347682694).
