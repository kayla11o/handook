# growth happens. rapid growth brings rapid change.

Growth makes a lot of things more difficult — people don’t know each other as well, information is harder to find, stuff gets lost, communication becomes muddled, it becomes harder to stay on top of everything that’s going on, etc. What worked for 3 or 5 people, doesn’t work as well at 6 or 8. And certainly not 20, 35, 55 or more.

Truthfully, it's not like it used to once be. Change is challenging across the board as some don’t enjoy new processes, structure, people, etc. 
and solving for each new thing unearths other issues or needs that can disrupt the flow.

At some point, growing small businesses need a system, something to stay organized, something to grow with so they don’t lose control of themselves along the way. Company-wide communication, team-based communication, and project work needs a home.

listening.                                                                                  

rethinking the agency model.                                                                
(traditional vs new; finding the balance between the two)                                   
                                                                                            
bringing in key resources and staff to share in the workload.                              

continue to create a culture that will become one of the ‘best places to work.’             


# *you.*

grace, patience, flexibility.

open communication with us and, most importantly, each other.
(if you have not delivered feedback to your colleagues, especially before 
talking to leadership, then that is not embodying radical candor and doing them a disservice.)

championship team mindset and engagement.
