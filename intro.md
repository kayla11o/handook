# verb employee handbook

Yes contractors, this is for you too.

For the past few years, we didn’t have a handbook. In that time, when a new person joined the company or a project, they were expected to figure things out for themselves. But as we continue to grow with multiple projects in the pipeline, our "introduction by immersion" style has begun to lose its effectiveness. New team members would feel lost and possibly isolate in their first few weeks on the job because of it. It can be unnerving to join any company, but perhaps verb in particular, given how different some of our practices are and lack of accessible information avaialable prior to onboarding. Before this handbook, navigating that path was both somewhat random and almost entirely oral; trying to figure out who to ask without seeming lost.

So, this is where we’ll try to share what’s worth knowing about verb; the company, our culture, our process, and our history. It’s a guide to understanding what people are talking about when referring to the cadence of work within the project matrix and sot (source of truth) or when they ask about  or whether it’s okay to take your a personal day if you have only been with us for a month (yes).

This handbook also offers us an opportunity to clarify who we actually are as a company. What do we stand for? How should we work? Codifying those beliefs into a handbook makes them tangible and, most importantly, editable. Making the company our best product is a guiding principle, but we can’t easily improve what we haven’t articulated. So whatever version of this handbook you’re reading, you can be sure it’s not the last. Please do help keep it up to date! And by up to date, we’re not just talking about misspellings and team changes. It’s just as much “we say we’re about X, but what we’re really doing is Y”. So many of these employee handbook projects turn out to be ideal-case prescriptions rather than real-world descriptions. They cover all the ways people should act, not the ways they actually do. That’s a sham. Let’s not write a handbook like that. Let’s keep it honest.

If you’re reading this just after joining the company, it’s particularly on you, actually. It’s harder for us who’ve been with verb for a while to spot the broken ways. Please take advantage of that glorious, shiny ignorance of being new, and question things.
